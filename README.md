# [Introductory Machine Learning in Python](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/28)
The <code>Introductory Machine Learning in Python</code> course, as suggested by its name, trully is an intro to <code>Machine Learning</code>, so don't expect much in terms of task complexity from it :) 

I did 4 full projects: 
<ol><li><code>Linear Regression from Scratch</code></li><li><code>Logistic Regression from Scratch</code></li><li><code>Data Analysis for Hospitals</code></li><li><code>Classification of Handwritten Digits</code></li></ol>
